They have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate realistic images, text, audio, and more. Among the most notable generative models are **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT).** Let’s explore each of these models, their mechanisms, and real-world applications."
